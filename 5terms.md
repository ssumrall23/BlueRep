# The Five Cryptography Terms
## By Sarah Sumrall

### Terms:
1. Key
  * _Tells you how to arrange the rules set by the cipher. Otherwise, they would be the same everytime and easy to decode the message_
2. Cipher
  * _The set of rules that you are using to encode the message_
3. Cribs
  * _Words in cryptography that are commonly used - you canâ€™t create a sentence without them_ 
4. Frequency Analysis
  * _How many times a letter is used in a cipher and how it is translated_
5. Cryptosystem
  * _Made up of all the parts that would encrypt and send a message/data_
